              parking fees incurred are the responsibility of the guarantor of
              this reservation. If for any reason, Falcon Tour Travel is unable
              to perform the service as contracted for, its liability shall be
              limited to no more than a full refund of any money paid by the

              for unforeseen traffic delays that could impact the timing of the
              client’s itinerary. Please allow for extra time if necessary.
              Falcon Tour Travel reserves the right to not perform service if
              the weather is inclement and could jeopardize the safety of
              passengers and chauffeurs. All Falcon Tour Travel drivers have the
              authority to determine if vehicles can safely enter a narrow
              driveway or make tight turns. All limo buses and vehicles operate
              in accordance with State and local traffic laws, and pick-up and
              drop-off at several city locations (including but not limited to
              Atlantic City, NJ, and New York, NY) are prohibited in several
              areas. Limo buses may be prohibited by law from traveling on
              certain roadways or expressways in various areas, as well as
              certain bridges and tunnels, and may have to plan alternate routes
              in compliance with these laws. Falcon Tour Travel is not
              responsible for additional time that may be incurred due to taking
              these alternate routes. Falcon Tour Travel is also not responsible
              for delays caused by adverse weather conditions, states of
              emergency, accidents, or detours while a ride is in progress.
              Clients should allow a reasonable amount of buffer time within
              their scheduling. Falcon Tour Travel cannot be held responsible
              for a start delay of under fifteen minutes. Falcon Tour Travel may
              also assist in obtaining promotions offered by area casinos but
              Falcon Tour Travel is not responsible for and cannot guarantee
              these promotions. For safety purposes, clients and their
              respective parties cannot walk in the vehicles while the vehicle
              is in motion. Clients and their respective parties are not to
              touch or attempt to open safety hatches on the vehicles except in
              the case of an accident or relevant emergency. Falcon Tour Travel
              will not be held responsible for any injury sustained if the
              vehicle must come to an immediate stop. Falcon Tour Travel
              reserves the right to charge the customer for any overtime charges
              incurred at the rate contracted. Overtime rates will be billed in
              half-hour increments, increasing to half-hour. There is no
              guarantee that overtime hours beyond the contracted block of time
              will be guaranteed. Falcon Tour Travel reserves the right to
              conclude services at any moment once the contracted time has
              expired. The itinerary for service is due ten days prior to the
              date of service. It is requested that the itinerary be completed
              on the forms provided. Falcon Tour Travel will not refund or
              reimburse clients if the driver is redirected to a route that
              deviates from the driver’s GPS or mapping and time is lost. Falcon
              Tour Travel will not refund or reimburse clients for time lost if
              the driver needs to find additional addresses not included on the
              original itinerary. This contract must be signed and returned
              prior to the date of service. Kegs, coolers, popcorn, chips, and
              glass beer bottles are prohibited in the cabin of the vehicle.
              Coolers can be stored in the storage areas or trunks of the
              vehicle if there is ample space. The stereo has an automatic
              shut-off when it reaches an excess level of volume. Falcon Tour
              Travel is well maintained, however, failure of DVD, TV, iPod, or
              stereo system to work during the course of service may result in a
              refund not to exceed a total of $50. Please check the vehicle upon
              exiting to make certain that items of value are not left behind.
              Personal belongings are ultimately the responsibility of the
              client or their owner.
